# WebSockets-in-FastAPI

This repository demonstrates the implementation of WebSockets in a FastAPI application. It includes examples of managing WebSocket connections, broadcasting messages, and handling real-time communication.

## Features

- **WebSocket Connection Management**: Handle multiple WebSocket connections efficiently.
- **Broadcasting Messages**: Send messages to all connected clients in real-time.
- **FastAPI Integration**: Leverage the power of FastAPI for building WebSocket-based applications.

## Files in the Repository

- `WebSocket.py`: Contains the main implementation of WebSocket connection management and broadcasting.
- `index.html`: A simple HTML file to test WebSocket connections.
- `mermaid.md`: A Mermaid diagram representing the `ConnectionManager` class and its methods.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn (for running the FastAPI application)
